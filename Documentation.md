- Is the HTML code properly validated by the W3C ?
- Are the HTML, JS and CSS files properly formatted ?
- Did you use clean code?
- Is the site responsive and easy for the customer to understand?
- Does the site have all the specifications requested by the company?

# 13 Git Workflow
Described by Vincent Driessen in 2010.
I used 3 branchs:
- Master 
- Develop
- Feature

+ “Master” is always ready to be released on LIVE, with everything fully tested and approved          (production-ready).
+ “Develop” is the branch to which all feature branches are merged and where all tests are performed. Only when everything’s been thoroughly checked and fixed it can be merged to the Master.

# 14 Project Tools
- Visual Studio Code
- git and gitHub
- Materialize.css
- Google Chrome Developer Tools
